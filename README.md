# NAIVE-BAYES
I have created Machine Learning Model With Naive Bayes Classifier for Stroke Predictions.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [Imblearn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/), [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and much more for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

**Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)!**
